# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-SVM-PIMA-Indian-Dataset-
This project applies a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel to predict the likelihood of diabetes in women using the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle – https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

Attributes include: pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.

Machine Learning Model\n
Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Kernel: Linear

Target: Binary classification — predicts whether the person is diabetic (1) or not (0)
